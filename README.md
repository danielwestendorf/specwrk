# Specwrk
Run your [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec) examples across many processors and many nodes for a single build. Or just many processes on a single node. Speeds up your *slow* (minutes/hours not seconds) test suite by running multiple examples in parallel. Optionally, retry failed examples up-to N-times to avoid breaking deployments.

One CLI command to:

1. Start a queue server for your current build
2. Seed the queue server with all possible examples in the current project
3. Execute

## Install
Start by adding `specwrk` to your project or installing it.
```sh
$ bundle add specwrk -g development,test
```
```sh
$ gem install specwrk
```

## CLI

```sh
$ specwrk --help

Commands:
  specwrk seed [DIR]            # Seed the server with a list of specs for the run
  specwrk serve                 # Start a queue server
  specwrk start [DIR]           # Start a server and workers, monitor until complete
  specwrk version               # Print version
  specwrk watch                 # Start a server and workers, watch for file changes in the current directory, and execute specs
  specwrk work                  # Start one or more worker processes
```

### `specwrk start -c 8 spec/`

### `specwrk watch -c 8` 
Starts `8` worker processes in watch mode for the current directory. Watched spec files will be distributed across the processes. By default, only looks at `_spec.rb` files. Configure a [watchfile](#create-a-watchfile-for-the-watch-command) to map file changes to spec files (i.e. modification of `app/models/user.rb` should run `spec/models/user_spec.rb` and `spec/system/users_spec.rb`).

```sh
$ specwrk watch --help
Command:
  specwrk watch

Usage:
  specwrk watch

Description:
  Start a server and workers, watch for file changes in the current directory, and execute specs

Options:
  --watchfile=VALUE                 # Path to watchfile configuration, default: "Specwrk.watchfile.rb"
  --count=VALUE, -c VALUE           # The number of worker processes you want to start, default: 1
  --help, -h                        # Print this help
```

## Configuring your test environment
If you test suite tracks state, starts servers, etc. and you plan on running many processes on the same node, you'll need to make
adjustments to avoid conflicting port usage or database/state mutations.

`specwrk` workers will have `TEST_ENV_NUMBER={i}` set to help you configure approriately.

### Rails
Rails has had easy multi-process test setup for a while now by creating unique test databases per process. For my rails v7.2 app which uses PostgreSQL and Capyabara, I made these changes to my `spec/rails_helper.rb`:

```diff
++ if ENV["TEST_ENV_NUMBER"]
++   ActiveRecord::TestDatabases.create_and_load_schema(
++     ENV["TEST_ENV_NUMBER"].to_i, env_name: ActiveRecord::ConnectionHandling::DEFAULT_ENV.call
++   )
++ end
-- Capybara.server_port = 5550
++ Capybara.server_port = 5550 + ENV.fetch("TEST_ENV_NUMBER", "1").to_i
++ Capybara.always_include_port = true
-- ActiveRecord::Migration.maintain_test_schema!
++ ActiveRecord::Migration.maintain_test_schema! unless ENV["SPECWRK_SEED"]
```

YMMV, but please submit an issue if your setup required more configuration.

## CI
Run `specwrk` in CI in either a single-node or multi-node configuration.

### Single-node, multi-process
Single-node, multi-process works best when you only have a single node running tests, but that node has many unused CPUs. This is similar to running `specwrk` locally with `bundle exec specwrk start spec/` which spins up a local server, seeds the server with examples that need to be run, and then spawns child worker processes which execute those examples in parallel.

Make sure to persist `$SPECWRK_OUT/report.json` between runs so that subsequent run queues can be optimized.

[GitHub Actions Example](https://github.com/danielwestendorf/specwrk/blob/main/.github/workflows/specwrk-single-node.yml)

[CircleCI Example](https://github.com/danielwestendorf/specwrk/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml) (specwrk-single-node job)

### Multi-node, multi-process
Multi-node, multi-process works best when have many nodes running tests. This distributes the test execution across the nodes until the queue is for the run is empty, optimizing for slowest specs first. This distributes test execution across all nodes evenly(-ish).

To accomplish this, a central queue server is required, examples must be explicitly seeded, and workers explicitly started.

1. Start a centralized queue server (see [Running a persistent Queue Server](#running-a-persistent-queue-server)) 
2. Seed the server with the specs for the current `SPECWWRK_RUN` pointed at your central server
3. Execute `specwrk work` for the given process count, for the current `SPECWRK_RUN`, pointed at your central server

[GitHub Actions Example](https://github.com/danielwestendorf/specwrk/blob/main/.github/workflows/specwrk-multi-node.yml)

[CircleCI Example](https://github.com/danielwestendorf/specwrk/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml) (see specwrk-multi-node-prepare, specwrk-multi-node jobs)


## Running a persistent Queue Server
Start a persistent Queue Server given one of the following methods
- The explicit ruby command `bundle exec specwrk serve --port $PORT`
- Via [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/danielwestendorf/specwrk-server/general): `docker run -e PORT=5139 -p 5139:5139 docker.io/danielwestendorf/specwrk-server:latest`
- By mounting the app as an Rack app (see `config.ru`)

### Configuring your Queue Server
- Secure your server with a key either with the `SPECWRK_SRV_KEY` environment variable or `--key` CLI option
- Configure the server output to be a persisted volume so your timings survive between system restarts with the `SPECWRK_SRV_STORE_URI` environment variable or `--store-uri` CLI option. By default, `memory:///` will be used for the run's data stores (so run data will no survive server restarts) while `file://#{Dir.tmpdir}` will be used for run timings. Pass `--store-uri file:///whatever/absolute/path` to store all data on disk (required for multiple server processes).

See [specwrk serve --help](#specwrk-serve) for all possible configuration options.

### Create a watchfile for the `watch` command
Watch file (default path is `Specwrk.watchfile.rb` in the current directory) is a ruby file that will be instance eval'd to configure the watcher. There are two commands available:

1. `ignore(Regexp)` to define files that should never trigger a run
2. `map(Regexp, &blk)` to map a file change to the spec files that should be run to that file change

By default, files without a `.rb` extension will be ignored and files ending with `_spec.rb` will be run. Presence of a watchfile will override these defaults.

```ruby
# Specwrk.watchfile.rb
# Ignore all files which don't have an .rb extension
ignore(/^(?!.*\.rb$).+/)

# When a _spec.rb file changes, it should be run
map(/_spec\.rb$/) do |spec_path|
  spec_path
end

# If a file in lib changes, map it to the spec folder for it's spec file
map(/lib\/.*\.rb$/) do |path|
  path.gsub(/lib\/(.+)\.rb/, "spec/\\1_spec.rb")
end

# If a model file changes (assuming rails app structure), run the model's spec file
# map(/app\/models\/.*.rb$/) do |path|
#   path.gsub(/app\/models\/(.+)\.rb/, "spec/models/\\1_spec.rb")
# end
#
# If a controlelr file changes (assuming rails app structure), run the controller and system specs file
# map(/app\/controllers\/.*.rb$/) do |path|
#   [
#     path.gsub(/app\/controllers\/(.+)\.rb/, "spec/controllers/\\1_spec.rb"),
#     path.gsub(/app\/controllers\/(.+)\.rb/, "spec/system/\\1_spec.rb")
#   ]
# end
```

## Prior/other works
There are many prior works for running rspec tests across multiple processes. Most of them combine process output making failures hard to grok. Some are good at running tests locally, but not on CI, while others are inversely true. Others are comercial or impactical without making a purchase.

specwrk is different because it:
1. Puts your developer experience first. Easy execution. No messy outputs. Retries built in. Easy(er) debugging of flaky tests. 
2. Is the same tool you use in development on your local box, in CI with a single runner, or CI with N number of runners.
3. Is easy to deploy and manage a queue server.
4. RSpec-only.
5. Is free.
